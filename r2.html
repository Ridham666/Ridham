    <p><h4>Rabindranath Tagore FRAS (/rəˈbɪndrənɑːt tæˈɡɔːr/ ⓘ; pronounced [roˈbindɾonatʰ ˈʈʰakuɾ];[1] 7 May 1861[2] – 8
        August 1941[3]) was an Indian poet, writer, playwright, composer, philosopher, social reformer and
        painter.[4][5][6] He reshaped Bengali literature and music as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in
        the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of the "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful" poetry of
        Gitanjali,[7] he became in 1913 the first non-European and the first lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in
        Literature.[8] Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; where his elegant prose and magical
        poetry were widely popular in the Indian subcontinent.[9] He was a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society. Referred
        to as "the Bard of Bengal",[10][5][6] Tagore was known by sobriquets: Gurudeb, Kobiguru, and
        Biswokobi.[a]Rabindranath Tagore FRAS (/rəˈbɪndrənɑːt tæˈɡɔːr/ ⓘ; pronounced [roˈbindɾonatʰ ˈʈʰakuɾ];[1] 7 May
